# Overview

The executive leadership of PyBer, a ride-sharing company, has asked us to analyze data from January 2019 to the end of April 2019 and make conclusions about the relationship between type of city and the number of drivers and riders, the total fares, as well as the average fares per ride and per driver. In addition to analysis, we were asked to produce visualizations to help showcase our analysis and help the company to improve their ride share services. 

# Results 

* Table 1: PyBer Summary

According the PyBer Summary (Table 1), we can see that urban areas has the most total rides (1,625), the most drivers (2,405), and the most overall total fares ($39,854.38). However, they have the least average fares per ride ($24.53) and average fares per Driver ($16.57). On the other hand, rural areas have the least number of total rides (125), the least number of total drivers (78), and the least amount of overall total fares ($4,327.93). Furthermore, they have the most average fares per ride ($34.62) and per driver ($55.49). These trends make sense seeing as it takes more time and money to get out to the more rural areas. This is the inverse of in urban areas, where there are far more quick trips which result in less overall money. 

We were also asked to look into fares week-by week from the first week of January to the last week of April. This can be seen in Table 2.

Overall, we can see that urban areas have the have the most fares per week and rural areas have the least fares per week, which follows our summary analysis. This can be further visualized in the line chart labeled Chart 1.

# Summary

Based on the analysis above, we can make three recommendations to the CEO and executive leadership. 

1) Rural areas are currently bringing in the least number of drivers, fares, and rides. PyBer should make a concerted marketing effort to bring more awareness to their product in these areas in order to boost their numbers here. 
2) Urban areas are currently doing well, but their riders area averaging low fares per driver. They should provide more incentives for urban drivers in order to improve this aspect of their business. 
3) Suburban areas are doing alright but they could benefit from targeted marketing or incentives. You could also do joint marketing between rural and suburban areas in order to augment their outputs.
