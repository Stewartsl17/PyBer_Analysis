# Overview

The executive leadership of PyBer, a ride-sharing company, has asked us to analyze data from January 2019 to May 2019 and make conculsions about the relationship between type of city and the number of drivers and riders, the total fares, as well as the average fares per ride and per driver. In addition to analysis, we were asked to produce visualizations to help showcase our analysis and help the company to improve their ride share services. 

# Results 

* Table 1: PyBer Summary

According the PyBer Summary (Table 1), we can see that urban areas has the most total rides (1,625), the most drivers (2,405), and the most overall total fares ($39,854.38). Moreover, they have the least average fares per ride ($24.53) and average fares per Driver ($16.57). On the other hand, rural areas has the least amount of total rides (125), the least amount of total drivers (78), and the least amount of overall total fares ($4,327.93). Furthermore, they have the most average fares per ride ($34.62) and per driver ($55.49). This trends make sense seeing as it takes more time and money to get out to the more rural areas. This is the inverse of in urban areas, where there are far more quick trips which result in less overall money.
